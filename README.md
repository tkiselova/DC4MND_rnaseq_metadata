**1. Planning and Requirement Analysis**

In the initial phase, the project team was assembled, and a first draft of the Software Management Plan (SMP) was developed to ensure alignment with FAIR4RS principles. 
During the ongoing requirement analysis stage, researchers and data stewards are being engaged through interviews, with surveys also planned, to identify key challenges in 
RNA-seq metadata management. These efforts have already helped to pinpoint essential metadata fields, clarify usability expectations, and highlight opportunities for 
automation to reduce manual effort and enhance reproducibility.

**2. System Design**

Based on the collected requirements, the team has initiated the system design phase by defining the structure and functionality of the FAIR-Compliant Metadata Framework. 
Modeled after ELIXIR’s Data Stewardship Wizard (https://ds-wizard.org/), the design is planned to include a guided, question-based user interface, integration of standardized 
ontologies (e.g., MIAME/MINSEQE, DCMI/ISA, EDAM), and support for metadata output in both human-readable formats and machine-readable formats. The system will be designed 
to be modular, scalable, and user-friendly for users with varying levels of technical and domain expertise.
