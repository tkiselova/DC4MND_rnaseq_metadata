**1. Planning and Requirement Analysis**
In the initial phase, the project team was assembled, and a first draft of the Software Management Plan (SMP) was developed to ensure alignment with FAIR4RS principles. 
During the ongoing requirement analysis stage, researchers and data stewards are being engaged through interviews, with surveys also planned, to identify key challenges in 
RNA-seq metadata management. These efforts have already helped to pinpoint essential metadata fields, clarify usability expectations, and highlight opportunities for 
automation to reduce manual effort and enhance reproducibility.
